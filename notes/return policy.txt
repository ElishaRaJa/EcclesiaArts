Here's a **ready-to-use return policy template** for your art sales. You can copy and paste it into your website, invoices, or online marketplace listings.

# **Return & Refund Policy**  

## **1. All Sales Are Final**  
Due to the unique nature of original artwork, **all sales are final**. Please carefully review the product images, descriptions, and details before making a purchase. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me before placing an order.  

## **2. Returns & Refunds for Damaged Artwork**  
If your artwork arrives **damaged**, you may request a refund or replacement under the following conditions:  
âœ… **Report the damage within 48 hours** of receiving the package.  
âœ… Provide **clear photos** of the damaged artwork and the packaging.  
âœ… The item must be returned in its **original packaging** (if applicable).  

Once we verify the damage, you will receive a refund or a replacement. If a replacement is not possible (e.g., one-of-a-kind artwork), a full refund will be issued.  

## **3. Lost or Missing Shipments**  
All orders are shipped with **tracking and insurance**. If your order is marked as delivered but has not arrived, please check with your local courier or neighbors first. If the package is lost in transit:  
âœ… Contact me so I can work with the shipping carrier to locate your package.  
âœ… If the package is confirmed lost, I will offer a refund or replacement.  

## **4. Return Shipping Costs**  
If a return is accepted due to damage, **I will cover the return shipping costs**. However, if a return is requested for any other reason (which is rare and only granted in exceptional cases), the **buyer is responsible for return shipping costs**.  

## **5. Custom & Import Fees**  
For international buyers, please note that you are responsible for any **import duties, taxes, or customs fees** imposed by your country. These charges are not included in the item price or shipping cost.  

## **6. Contact Information**  
For any issues or return requests, please contact me at:
