# Architecture Decision Record: Error Handling System

## Date: 2025-04-25

### Status: Accepted

### Context:
Needed consistent error handling across:
- Authentication flows
- Data fetching
- User interactions
- CRUD operations

### Decision:
Implemented a unified system with:
1. Standard error codes (AUTH-001, DATA-002, etc.)
2. Toast notifications for user feedback
3. Centralized error handler utility
4. Loading states for async operations

### Consequences:
- Consistent user experience
- Easier debugging
- Maintainable error handling
- Slightly increased bundle size
