im ready to implement bob go i created a sandbox account and have the api key and also check the webwiste a ddid research : api key: 97c2fc308a4647198f065b868d579aaa: research: Okay, that's a clear explanation of Bob Go's Bearer Token Authentication. Let's break it down and see how to use it in your React code. Understanding Bearer Token Authentication Bearer Token: A "Bearer Token" is a string of characters that acts like a password, authorizing your application to make requests to the Bob Go API. Authorization Header: To authenticate your API requests, you must include the Bearer Token in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests. Format: The Authorization header should have this format: "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR\_UNIQUE\_TOKEN" Replace YOUR\_UNIQUE\_TOKEN with the actual token you obtained from your Bob Go account. Key Points Security is Crucial: Keep Your Token Secret: Treat your Bearer Token like a password. Never expose it in your client-side React code where users can see it (e.g., in a JavaScript file). HTTPS: Always use HTTPS when making API requests to protect your token during transmission. Token Expiration: Bearer tokens can expire. Your application should be able to handle this (the Bob Go documentation should explain how to renew tokens, if needed). Simplified Authentication: Bearer Token authentication is designed to be simpler than older methods. You just need to include the token in the header. Stateless: The server doesn't keep track of your login session. Each request is authenticated independently by the token. OAuth 2.0: This authentication method is based on the OAuth 2.0 standard, which is a widely used and secure way to authorize API access. How to Use the Token in Your React Code You will include the Authorization header in your API requests using a library like axios or the built-in fetch API. Here's an example using axios: JavaScript import axios from 'axios'; const bobGoApi = axios.create({ baseURL: 'https://api.sandbox.bobgo.co.za/v2/', // Or the production URL headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Authorization': \`Bearer YOUR\_UNIQUE\_TOKEN\` // Replace with your actual token } }); // Example: Making a request to get shipping rates async function getShippingRates(address: ShippingAddress, packageDetails: any) { try { const response = await bobGoApi.post('/shipping/rates', { // Use the correct endpoint destination\_address: address, package: packageDetails }); return response.data; } catch (error: any) { console.error("Error fetching shipping rates:", error); throw error; // Re-throw to be handled in the component } } Important Considerations Where to Store the Token: You should store your Bearer Token on your server (in a secure environment variable or configuration file), not directly in your React code. Your React code should make requests to your server, and your server will then include the token in the requests it makes to the Bob Go API. Backend API: This means you'll need to create a backend API endpoint in your application (using Node.js, Python, or whatever server-side language you're using) to act as an intermediary between your React frontend and the Bob Go API. what would you advise based of my currect structure and flow
